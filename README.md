<h1>Key Logger with Python and pynput</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project consists of creating a basic key logger program in Python that records all keyboard input from host. The keyboard data will then be sent to a .txt file with timestamps.</p>



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b> Python + pynput</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b> Visual Studio Code</b> 

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

- <b>Create a Python program that records all keyboard input</b> 
- <b>Ensure the program sends all keyboard input to the .txt file</b> 


<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<h2>Findings:</h2>

- <b> After Installing Nmap I verified that I was currently running Nmap version 7.60.</b>
- <b> Acesssing the help/man page can assist you in locating proper key commands and finding out how to scan for specific output.</b>
- <b> Running an aggressive scan with options can help you customize and optimize scan results in a more accurate and timely fashion.</b> 
- <b> Found port 80 to be open during the basic network scan which would indicate the network may be vulnerable to SQL injection, cross-site-scripting, cross-site-request-forgery and Ddos attacks.</b>
